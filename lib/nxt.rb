# Examples:
# 
#   nxt = NXT.new('/dev/tty.NXT-DevB-1')
#   
#   nxt.motor_a do |m|
#     m.forward(:degrees => 180, :power => 15)

#   nxt.motors_bc do |m|
#     m.backward(:time => 5, :power => 20)
#   end
#   
#   nxt.motors_abc do |m|
#     m.reset_tacho
#     m.forward(:time => 3, :power => 10)
#     puts "Motor #{m.name} moved #{m.read_state[:degree_count]} degrees."

  # * Port 1: Touch
  # * Port 2: Sound
  # * Port 3: Light
  # * Port 4: Ultrasonic
  # You can specify the path to the serialport device (e.g. '/dev/tty.NXT-DevB-1')
  # or omit the argument to use the serialport device specified in the global
  # $DEV variable.
