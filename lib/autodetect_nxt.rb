# This script attempts to automatically set the global $DEV variable
# by searching for a NXT tty device node.

# TODO: This curently only works on *nix based systems (MacOS X too!)
#       I don't know how to implement this for Win32 :(

# If there is an NXT or DEV environment variable, or a $DEV global,
# we'll use that and not try to auto-set it ourselves.
